                            <td><p>1. God warned humanity not to eat from the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil (Genesis 3:3) because He knew what it would lead to. God clearly said that if they ate it, they would die. This was not just about physical death, but about what would happen inside the human heart. When they ate the fruit, evil entered human nature. That evil began to pull humanity toward sin, and sin eventually led to death.</p>

<p>God had already spoken the truth to them, but instead of trusting God and holding on to their faith, they listened to the deceiver, Satan. They chose to believe his words over God’s words, and that choice changed everything.</p>

<p>2. After this, God stopped humanity from eating from the tree of life (Genesis 3:22–24). This was not because God wanted to punish them, but because He wanted to protect them. Now that humans knew evil, living forever in that broken condition would have meant endless wickedness, pain, and corruption. So God kept them away from the tree of life out of mercy, not cruelty.</p>

<p>From the beginning, God wanted humans to know only good and to live forever in peace and righteousness. That original intention did not disappear. In the book of Revelation (21:1–7; 22:1–5), we see God promising eternal life again—this time in a world where sin and evil are completely removed. Through Jesus Christ, God assures us that eternal life will be restored to those who believe (John 5:24).</p>

<p>3. If Satan truly cared about humanity or had a good heart, he would have pointed Eve to the tree of life instead of the fruit that led to death (Genesis 2:9). But he did not. His actions show his true nature—deception and destruction. Satan offered knowledge that brought death, while God offered life without evil.</p></td>
